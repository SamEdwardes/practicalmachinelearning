# Classes

Six young health participants were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions: 

- exactly according to the specification (Class A), 
- throwing the elbows to the front (Class B), 
- lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C), 
- lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D),
- and throwing the hips to the front (Class E).
